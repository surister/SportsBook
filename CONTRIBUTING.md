First of all I'd like to thank you for considering contributing to this project. If the following guidelines are abided by
contributing and testing will be a pleasure for everybody.

1) The most important thing for me here is that everybody who participates in any communication treats eevrybody with respect.
This is regardless of knowledge, ability, age, sex, race, sexuality, whatever. We're all here for our passion for code
and probably passion for data. Let's all get along and enjoy!

2) Please keep your fork upto date as much as possible. While the project is relatively small, it's fairly
common for merging issues to arise.

3) Communicate. Please raise issues, join the clack group (check the bottom of this document) and comment. There's no point in 
two of us working on the same aspect of the project unless we are working on it together.

4) Go easy on me! This is the first realy code project I've done and it will show in my code and the way I handle the project.
However, I'm not keen on having major updates of code that I don't understand myself. If there's something you think would help,
message me on Slack or raise an issue and we can discuss it. Otherwise, feel free to fork or clone and take your branch in that
direction.

Thank you for reading. Have fun!
